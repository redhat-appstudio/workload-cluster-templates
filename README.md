# Workload Cluster Templates

This repository contains openshift templates for the management of resources that we need deployed
directly to workload clusters.

It is referenced by App-SRE's app-interface repository, which deploys these resources to various
workload clusters.

Almost all other service resources are managed in the
[infra-deployments](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments/) repo.
